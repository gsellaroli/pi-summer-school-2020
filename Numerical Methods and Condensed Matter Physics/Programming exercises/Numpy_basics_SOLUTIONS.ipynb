    "Now we'll consider what operations we can do with a matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Get the shape of a matrix: ```M.shape```\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Access elements: ```M[a,b]``` returns the element in row ```a```, column ```b```.  ```M[a,:]``` or just ```M[a]``` returns the whole of row ```a```, and ```M[:,b]``` returns column ```b```.  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: rows and columns are \"0-indexed\" meaning that the top row of a matrix and leftmost column are labeled as 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Add matrices: if two matrices M and N have the same shape, ```M+N``` will return the sum of the two matrices.  If the shapes don't match it will give an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Multiply matrices: matrix multiplication uses the ```@``` symbol.  For ```M``` (m x k) and ```N``` (k x n) matrix, ```M @ N``` returns the (m x n) matrix product.  IMPORTANT NOTES: (i) ```*``` does not work.  It returns the elementwise, or Hadamard, product instead, which you almost never want. (ii) The ```@``` operator does not exist in Python 2.  If you must use Python 2, you can use ```np.dot(M,N)``` instead.  (You should use Python 3.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Raise a square matrix to a power ```n```: ```np.linalg.matrix_power(M, n)```.  NOTE: Do not do ```M**n```, which will raise every element of ```M``` to power ```n``` individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Multiply by a vector.  To act on a length k vector with an (m x k) matrix, use ```M @ v``` just like for multiplying two matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "(7) Take a transpose.  Either ```M.transpose()``` or ```np.transpose(M)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "(8) Take complex conjugate.  ```M.conjugate()``` or ```M.conj()``` or ```np.conjugate(M)``` or ```np.conj(M)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Take adjoint/Hermitian conjugate: no shortcut, you have to do (7) and (8).\n",
    "\n",
    "(10) Find the \"norm\" of the matrix, which is the square root of the sum of absolute value squared of all elements in the matrix, using ```np.linalg.norm(M)```.\n",
    "\n",
    "(11) Get eigenvalues and eigenvectors: ```e, v = np.linalg.eig(M)```.  ```e``` is a vector containing the eigenvalues of ```M```, and ```v``` is a vector whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors.  So eg ```v[:,1]``` will give the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue ```e[1]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "(12) Compare matrices.  In python you can generally check equality using ```a == b```, which will return ```True``` if ```a``` and ```b``` are equal and ```False``` otherwise, but there are some serious issues.  First, for matrices this checks elementwise, so if two matrices are equal it will return ```np.array( [[True,True],[True,True]] )```.  This is pretty annoying to work with.  Instead you can use ```np.array_equal(M,N)``` which will retun a single ```True``` or ```False``` as expected.  There is a still a problem with numerical error, as for example $1 + 10^{-16}$ and $1$ are probably actually equal but the function will return ```False```.  So it is usually best to instead check the size of the difference between the matrices, like this: ```np.linalg.norm(M-N) < 10**-12```.  \n",
    "\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice.  Check the following, using these operations and the matrices you've defined above:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Each of the Pauli matrices is Hermitian (I demonstrate this one for Sy as an example).\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Each Pauli matrix squares to the identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues 1 and -1.\n",
    "\n",
